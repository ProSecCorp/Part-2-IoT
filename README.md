## Setup
### Project
All project source files are in the [Source directory](./Source/).

### LaTeX
To enable custom output paths and file naming via `latexmkrc`, the default LaTeX Workshop recipe must be replaced with a minimal one. Add the following entries to your VS Code `settings.json`:
```
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
  {
    "name": "latexmk-custom",
    "command": "latexmk",
    "args": ["-pdf", "-shell-escape", "-enable-write18", "%DOC%"]
  }
],

"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
  {
    "name": "latexmk (custom)",
    "tools": ["latexmk-custom"]
  }
]
```
Use **latexmk (custom)** when building the report.
This ensures LaTeX Workshop does not override `latexmkrc`, allowing the project’s custom output directory, jobname, and image paths to work as intended.
